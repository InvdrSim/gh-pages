An unknown evil has infected the world.
Where is the infection coming from? And what happened to all the inhabitants of a once lively world? The only hope for the return of peace rests on a young shaman woman.

In this jump-n-run game prototype you explore the world, fight infected monsters and uncover the secrets of a mysterious world. 

Developed as a master thesis project, this prototype explores themes of hope and resilience in a post-apocalyptic world. This project was created in collaboration with Sebastian Flöth and Jonathan Dawo.

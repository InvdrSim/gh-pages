## Building a Stereo Panorama Camera for Real Estate

![Stereo camera](/assets/img/projects/stereo-camera/thumbnail.jpg)

Imagine showcasing a property not just in flat, static images, but in immersive, 3D panoramas that let viewers virtually step inside and explore every nook and cranny. That was the vision that drove us to embark on a unique project during my time at [Azury Living](https://azury.de): building a **custom stereo panorama camera**.

**Frustrated by the lack of commercially available cameras** offering both high quality and true stereoscopic capture, we set out to create our own solution. Overcoming technical hurdles, we meticulously assembled a camera system using two Sony Alpha 6500s (later upgraded to a single Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera), meticulously synchronized and calibrated for flawless 3D capture.

The resulting cameras have been in **active use for over five years**, becoming a cornerstone of my employer's marketing strategy. Our stereo panoramic tours have captivated potential buyers, setting our properties apart from the competition and contributing to **significantly faster sales**.

What makes these cameras special? Firstly, the **seamless stereoscopy**. Gone are the distracting artifacts often seen in stitched panoramas; viewers experience a natural, **depth-perceived immersion** that feels like being there. Secondly, the **high image quality** ensures every detail shines, from intricate architectural details to the warm glow of a fireplace.

But hardware wasn't enough. To bridge the gap between raw footage and usable panoramas, I developed a **custom stitching solution**. This solution, precisely calibrated to the camera rig's configuration, ensures **artifact-free, high-quality panoramas**. It required a thorough understanding of stereoscopic vision and real estate photography principles to achieve optimal results.

To further enhance efficiency and convenience, I created a dedicated **mobile app for remote camera control**. This app eliminates the need for physical manipulation of the rig, allowing for seamless operation from a distance.

This project resonated beyond its practical application. It allowed me to leverage my **technical expertise** to develop a solution that demonstrably enhanced the agency's marketing capabilities. Witnessing the positive response to the stereo panoramas and their contribution to improved marketing efforts was deeply rewarding. This unique and successful endeavor confidently demonstrates my ability to think creatively and deliver solutions with real-world impact.

### Responsibilities

- **Conceptualization and Project Lead:** I identified the need for a high-quality stereoscopic panorama camera solution and spearheaded the project from its initial conception.
- **Hardware Development:** As part of the team, I played a key role in designing and assembling the camera rig, my understanding of photography principles proving invaluable in optimizing and ensuring stability for flawless capture.
- **Software Development:** I served as the sole developer for both the panorama stitching software and the mobile control app, diving deep into the intricacies of shader development and leveraging my thorough understanding of camera operation to bridge the gap between raw footage and usable panoramas.
  - **Stitching Software:** Utilizing Unity, I built a custom stitching tool that seamlessly processes captured footage into high-quality, artifact-free panoramas.
  - **Mobile Control App:** Leveraging Xamarin, I developed a dedicated mobile app for remote camera control, streamlining the capture process and facilitating convenient operation.

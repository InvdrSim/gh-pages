Experience the freedom of the open road in this VR prototype, where you control a virtual motorcycle using a real-life spring rider. This project explores the potential of using physical movement for intuitive VR interaction.

Straddle up on the spring rider and embark on a tranquil journey through a low-poly dreamscape bathed in the soft glow of night. The position and orientation of the Vive controller attached to the spring rider are translated into real-time movement and steering, allowing you to navigate the serene environment at your own pace.

This prototype focuses on the core experience of recreating the physical sensation of riding a motorcycle in VR. While there are currently no specific goals, enemies, or challenges, the low-poly aesthetic and immersive interaction create a peaceful and captivating atmosphere.

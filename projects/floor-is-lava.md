## Escape the Lost Mayan Temple!

Navigate through a perilous environment as an explorer, using real-time motion capture animation (provided by Captury) to bring your character to life. This Unity-developed game challenges you to jump from platform to platform while dodging fireballs, all while avoiding the ever-approaching lava.

# About me

Hi, I'm Simon, a passionate and dedicated Unity developer with over 10 years of experience. For the last 5 years, I've been immersed in the world of VR, crafting compelling experiences that push the boundaries of imagination. My design philosophy prioritizes user comfort, accessibility, and clear interactions.

When I am not developing, you can find me playing video games, making music or enjoying the sun!

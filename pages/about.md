# About me

Hi, I'm Simon, a passionate and dedicated Unity developer with over ten years of experience. For the last six years, I've been immersed in the world of VR, crafting compelling experiences that push the boundaries of imagination. My design philosophy prioritizes user comfort, accessibility, and clear interactions.

When I am not developing, you can find me playing video games, cooking or baking bread, making music or enjoying the sun and riding my bike!
